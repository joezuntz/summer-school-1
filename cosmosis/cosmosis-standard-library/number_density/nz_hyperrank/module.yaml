explanation: |
    "This module is designed to work with the number density part of the FITS
    files described in:
    http://github.com/joezuntz/2point/

    Uncertainty in the redshift distributions is usually described by a nuisance
    parameter which allows the mean of the distribution to be shifted from a fiducial
    central value.
    This value is then marginalized in the pipeline.
    But higher order distribution moments which are not captured by this paramterization
    can propagate into the cosmological parameters and its uncertainty ignored.

    An empirical approach to solve this is to provide multiple realisations of the
    redshift distributions n(z) containing realistic samples of the higher order moments.
    as well as the small redshift scale variance.
    We can then sample from them directly rather than using nuisance to capture the
    full effect of the shapes of the redshift distributions, as well as their internal
    correlation.

    This module extends the load_nz_fits module to read multiple realisations, one per
    extension.
    It then ranks the realisations depending on the selected mode and maps it to a continuous
    hyper-parameter which can be sampled in the pipeline.
    The ranking is intended to provide a meaningful metric in the n(z) space, allowing
    for better sampling efficiency over random sampling of the realisations.

    data_set: "String, names of the extensions prefixes in the FITS files to load and save to the block"
    n_bins: "Integer, number of tomographic bins"
    n_hist: "Integer, number of redshift histogram bins at which n(z) is evaluated"
    n_realisations: "Integer, number of realisations contained in the FITS file, numbered from 0 to n_realisations-1"
    external_ranking_filename: "String, path to a plain text file with a 1D array of length = n_realisations with values to be ranked"
